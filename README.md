# Practical Inclusivity San Francisco

Practical Inclusivity SF is a new kind of meetup designed to help the tech industry be better. Each event focuses on a different, specific inclusivity topic. The event begins with a speaker who introduces the concept for the evening, followed with an hour long facilitated group discussion about the topic.

Our first meetup will be held on March 13th, 2018 at 6pm PDT. If you would like to attend, [please register here](https://nebrius.typeform.com/to/GRkZvj). See you there! For our first meetup, we're going to keep the topic general: what are common challenges people face in building diverse teams, organizations, and communities, with Bryan and Amanda speaking briefly on the topic.

## Mission

**Practical Inclusivity SF's mission is to empower people in tech to improve the diversity and inclusivity of their teams, organizations, and communities.**

Practical Inclusivity SF is a space where attendees can learn practical steps they can take at a grass-roots level to make their corner of the tech industry better.

Practical Inclusivity is a space for:
- Those who care about building inclusive teams, organizations, and communities
- Those already working on inclusivity efforts to share what they're working on and what they've learned
- Those looking to start, or get involved in, inclusivity efforts in their current teams, organizations, and communities

We believe that by sharing and learning from each others' experiences, we can add our voice to the broader community of organizations working to establish best practices for building and supporting inclusive workplaces.

## Values

Practical Inclusivity SF is a unique type of event. We bring together people from a wide variety of backgrounds to discuss topics that are often contentious. To ensure that conversations are respectful and productive, we have crafted this set of values that each attendee is expected to embody.

**Focus**: We value conversations that pay careful attention to the topic at hand and contribute to it in a positive way.

**Respect**: We value conversation and collaboration over debates and arguments.

**Experiences**: We will prioritize the stories, experiences, and feelings of marginalized people over the comfort of privileged people.

**Intersectionality**: Effective inclusivity requires that we consider the many combinations and categories of marginalizations.

**Community**: We want to empower the broader communities we're a part of. To incorporate and participate in inclusivity best-practices, we must keep the context of the broader community in mind.

We have a [Code of Conduct](./code_of_conduct.md) in place to ensure that these values are protected and promoted at our events. Please be familiar with it before attending a Practical Inclusivity SF event.
